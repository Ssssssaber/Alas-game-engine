* adding new components during runtime with lua scripts
New Systems to implement:
* Resource manager UI for attaching scripts, shaders and textures to entity
* Deploying the game

Improvements:
* Processing multiple lua scripts effectively
* Rework lua scripting api (https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/151089/binding-c-templated-functions-to-lua)

Needs to fixed:
<!-- * Worldspace text invalid movement -->
* Circle colliders instead of quads for some reason
* Create base textures and shaders in case others are missing
<!-- * Circle collider callbacks -->

<!-- * Framebuffer implementation to render scene into imgui subwindow
    Make it compatible with gameloop window -->

Issues:
* Camera view crops everything greater than 1280x720 (somewhat fixed)
